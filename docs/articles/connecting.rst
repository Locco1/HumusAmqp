Connecting to RabbitMQ with HumusAmqp
=====================================

Connection configuration
------------------------

Map options that HumusAmqp will recognize are

-  ``:host``            - amqp.host The host to connect too. Note: Max 1024 characters.
-  ``:port``            - amqp.port Port on the host.
-  ``:vhost``           - amqp.vhost The virtual host on the host. Note: Max 128 characters.
-  ``:login``           - amqp.login The login name to use. Note: Max 128 characters.
-  ``:password``        - amqp.password Password. Note: Max 128 characters.
-  ``:persistent``      - Establish a persistent connection with the AMQP broker, if set to true.
-  ``:connect_timeout`` - Connection timeout. Note: 0 or greater seconds. May be fractional.
-  ``:read_timeout``    - Timeout in for income activity. Note: 0 or greater seconds. May be fractional.
-  ``:write_timeout``   - Timeout in for outcome activity. Note: 0 or greater seconds. May be fractional.
-  ``:heartbeat``       - The heartbeat to use. Should be approx half the read_timeout.
-  ``:cacert``          - CA Cert for SSL Connections
-  ``:cert``            - Cert for SSL Connections
-  ``:key``             - Key for SSL Connections
-  ``:verify``          - Verify SSL Certs (true or false)

Default parameters
------------------

Default connection parameters are

.. code-block:: php

    [
      'host'         => "localhost",
      'port'         => 5672,
      'vhost'        => "/",
      'login'        => "guest",
      'password'     => "guest",
      'persistent'   => false,
      'connect_timeout' => 1.0,
      'read_timeout'  => 1.0,
      'write_timeout' => 1.0,
      'heartbeat' => 0,
    ]

Creating a connection
---------------------

.. code-block:: php

    $options = new Humus\Amqp\ConnectionOptions();
    $options->setLogin('username');
    $options->setPassword('password');

    $connection = new Humus\Amqp\Driver\AmqpExtension\Connection($options);
    $connection->connect();

Opening a Channel
-----------------

Some applications need multiple connections to RabbitMQ. However, it is
undesirable to keep many TCP connections open at the same time because
doing so consumes system resources and makes it more difficult to
configure firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with
channels that can be thought of as "lightweight connections that share a
single TCP connection".

To open a channel:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $connection = new Humus\Amqp\Driver\PhpAmqpLib\SocketConnection(new Humus\Amqp\ConnectionOptions());
    $channel    = $connection->newChannel();

Channels are typically long lived: you open one or more of them and use
them for a period of time, as opposed to opening a new channel for each
published message, for example.

Using configuration and factory
-------------------------------

You can simply configure as many connection as needed and simply give them a name.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    return [
        'dependencies' => [
            'factories' => [
                Driver::class => Humus\Amqp\Container\DriverFactory::class,
                'default-amqp-connection' => [Humus\Amqp\Container\ConnectionFactory::class, 'default'],
            ],
        ],
        'humus' => [
            'amqp' => [
                'driver' => 'php-amqplib',
                'connection' => [
                    'default' => [
                        'type' => 'socket',
                        'register_pcntl_heartbeat_sender' => true,
                        'host' => 'localhost',
                        'port' => 5672,
                        'login' => 'guest',
                        'password' => 'guest',
                        'vhost' => '/',
                        'persistent' => true,
                        'read_timeout' => 3, //sec, float allowed
                        'write_timeout' => 1, //sec, float allowed
                    ],
                ],
            ]
        ]
    );

.. note:: When using php-amqplib as driver, you have five different connection classes available:
    `LazyConnection`, `LazySocketConnection`, `SocketConnection`, `SslConnection` and `StreamConnection`.
    Which connection type should be used, can be configured with the `type` option and the settings:
    `lazy`, `lazy_socket`, `socket`, `ssl` or `stream`.

.. note:: When using php-amqplib as driver, you may enable its provided PNCTL heartbeat sender by setting 
    the `register_pcntl_heartbeat_sender` option to true. It is off by default.


Getting a connection
--------------------

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $defaultConnection = $container->get('default-amqp-connection');
